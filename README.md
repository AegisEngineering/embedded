# Embedded
Hi, and welcome to my repository for all my personal embedded electronics projects. It will feature engineering projects of various types including electronics hardware design, low level "bare-metal" firmware written with C / ARM asm, and high level firmware using abstraction layers.


## Completed projects
-

## Current projects
- RGB Blinky on Tiva C TM4C123GXL using ARM asm
- Hitachi HD44780 LCD Driver on STM32F103C8T6 (Black Pill)

## Future projects
- Real-time operating system "AegisOS" on STM32F4x (basic scheduler supporting multi-threading, possibly more)
- Basic handheld calculator (Hardware schematic, PCB design, and firmware)
- Handheld MP3 player (Hardware schematic, PCB design, and firmware)
